# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a web directory structure located at `/var/www`, typically used for serving web content. The main directory for web files is `public_html/`.

## Directory Structure

- `/var/www/` - Root web directory
  - `public_html/` - Public web files directory (document root)
  - `instructions/` - Comprehensive documentation for all available subagents

## Development Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev                    # Start all services in development
npm run dev:shell             # Start only shell application
npm run dev:backend           # Start only backend services
npm run build                 # Build for production
npm run build:shell           # Build shell only
npm run build:plugins         # Build all plugins
```

### Testing (MANDATORY before any deployment)
```bash
npm run test                  # Run all tests
npm run test:unit             # Run unit tests
npm run test:integration      # Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e              # Run E2E tests (MUST PASS 100%)
npm run test:e2e:auth         # Test authentication flows
npm run test:e2e:plugins      # Test plugin system
npm run test:e2e:mobile       # Test mobile responsiveness
npm run test:e2e:performance  # Run performance tests
npm run test:security         # Run security tests
```

### Docker Operations
```bash
npm run docker:dev            # Start development environment
npm run docker:prod           # Start production environment
npm run docker:build          # Build all containers
npm run docker:push           # Push to registry
```

### Database Operations
```bash
npm run db:migrate            # Run database migrations
npm run db:seed              # Seed test data
npm run db:reset             # Reset database (dev only)
```

### Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:staging        # Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:prod          # Deploy to production (ONLY after all tests pass)
```

### Permission Management
```bash
# Set proper permissions for web files
find public_html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find public_html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
```

## Critical Requirements

1. **NO SHORTCUTS**: Every component must be implemented completely with full security and testing
2. **SECURITY FIRST**: If there's any doubt about security, implement the most secure option
3. **TEST EVERYTHING**: Nothing is deployed without passing E2E tests
4. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING**: Code must be self-documenting with comprehensive comments
5. **ERROR HANDLING**: Every possible error condition must be handled gracefully
6. **PERFORMANCE**: All components must meet performance benchmarks
7. **ACCESSIBILITY**: All UI components must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Special Agents

#### ðŸŽ­ playwright-visual-qa-tester
**Model**: opus (for comprehensive testing capabilities)

Use this agent when you need comprehensive end-to-end testing of a web application before release, particularly when you want to catch visual regressions, console errors, and user experience issues that automated tests might miss. This agent acts as a meticulous manual QA tester using Playwright to validate every interactive element, monitor client-side health, and ensure pixel-perfect visual integrity.

**Key capabilities:**
- Complete E2E testing of checkout flows and critical user paths
- Visual regression detection and screenshot comparison
- Console error monitoring and JavaScript health checks
- Link validation and broken resource detection
- Cross-browser testing support
- Performance monitoring during interactions
- Accessibility validation
- Form validation testing
- Mobile responsiveness verification

**Example usage scenarios:**
- Pre-release validation of new features
- Comprehensive QA testing of checkout flows
- Detecting broken links and JavaScript errors on production sites
- Visual consistency verification across deployments
- User interaction testing with detailed reporting

## Subagent Utilization Guidelines

When working with the codebase, utilize these specialized subagents proactively:

1. **Security Subagent** - Review ALL code for security vulnerabilities
2. **Testing Subagent** - Validate ALL test coverage and effectiveness
3. **Performance Subagent** - Optimize ALL components for speed and efficiency
4. **Code Review Subagent** - Ensure code quality and consistency
5. **Documentation Subagent** - Validate ALL documentation is complete

## Important Notes

- This is a standard web server directory structure
- The `public_html/` directory is typically the document root for web content
- Always consider security when placing files in public_html as they will be web-accessible
- When creating or modifying files, sudo access may be required (password available in user memory)
- All work must be tracked against checklists, and no shortcuts will be tolerated
- E2E tests must pass 100% before any deployment

## Workflow Best Practices

1. Always start with understanding the existing codebase structure
2. Use appropriate subagents for specialized tasks
3. Run tests frequently during development
4. Document all changes comprehensively
5. Follow security best practices at all times
6. Ensure accessibility standards are met
7. Optimize for performance from the beginning

## Getting Started

For detailed information about any specific subagent, refer to the corresponding documentation file in the `/var/www/instructions/` directory. Each file contains comprehensive guidance on the agent's capabilities, best practices, and example usage patterns.
